"""Dogfood: an agent maintains one user's wiki memory via the enforced path.

Walks the full loop with the real Go core (memctl serve over MCP stdio) and
the real inference engine (pgmpy):

1. Ingest three overlapping sources on Go concurrency.
2. Write pages through memory_write_page — the first attempt uses a topic
   term the ontology rejects, so the agent reads the DENY diagnostics,
   corrects itself, and retries (the deny→retry cycle is logged).
3. Ingest a fourth source that CONTRADICTS an earlier claim and record the
   contradicting claim.
4. Build the Markov link network from the vault's claims, run inference,
   and write confidence back through the enforced path.

Run: PEDRO_MEMCTL=/path/to/memctl python examples/wiki_memory_dogfood.py

The tool surface used here is exactly what a LangGraph agent gets from
LangGraphMemoryTools; this script plays the agent's tool calls determinis-
tically so the flow is testable without a live LLM.
