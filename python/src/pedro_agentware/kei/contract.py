"""KEI harness contract definition.

This module defines the contract between a third-party harness and the
pedro-agentware library. The contract specifies what a harness MUST implement
versus what the library provides.

Security model: fail-closed. Unknown policy decisions, unreachable proxies,
missing credentials, and expired tokens all result in DENY.
